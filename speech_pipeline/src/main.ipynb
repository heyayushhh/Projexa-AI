      " Hi  everybody,  this  is  Pam  coming  to  you  from  the  debut  episode  of  a  new  addition  to  the  blog  make  room  for  this  uttering.  Today  I'm  going  to  introduce  his  stories.  She  asks  him  and  my  goal  is  to  introduce  a  little  bit  of  the  male  perspective  on  this  crazy  thing  that  we  all  know  as  stuttering.  So  for  my  debut  male  guest  I'm  really  excited  to  say  hello  to  Alan.  Hi  Alan,  how  are  you?  Good  afternoon.  It's  good  afternoon  here  in  Wales  in  the  United  Kingdom.  I  suspect  it's  still  morning  with  you  or  just  into  the  afternoon  in  the  New  York  area.  That  is  correct.  It's  time  and  it's  a  beautiful  Saturday  afternoon  here  kind  of  chilly  but  it's  one  of  those  days  where  I  don't  mind  at  all  staying  in  talking  with  good  friends  and  probably  later  on  getting  some  housework  done.  Good  for  you.  So  Alan,  for  our  listeners  could  you  formally  introduce  yourself,  your  name  and  again  where  you're  from  and  what  you  do  with  yourself  these  days?  I  will  introduce  myself  even  though  as  you  know  I'm  a  shy  and  retiring  guy.  My  name  is  Alan  Badminton  and  I'll  spell  that  because  everybody  spells  it  incorrectly.  B -A -D -M -I -N -G -T -O -N.  Everybody  leaves  out  the  G  and  I'm  from  Wales  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  Wales  just  to  give  you  a  brief  geographical  lesson,  Wales  is  one  of  the  four  countries  that  make  up  the  United  Kingdom  along  with  England,  Scotland  and  Northern  Ireland.  So  I  live  in  Wales.  I've  always  lived  in  Wales  and  I've  lived  here  for  quite  a  long  time  because  I'm  getting  quite  long  in  the  tooth.  Okay.  I've  started,  I'm  so  sorry  I  interrupted  you,  I  was  just  going  to  say  I've  started  since  the  very  early  age  of  three.  And  you  speak  obviously  very  clearly  and  very  fluidly  as  we're  hearing  you.  You've  stuttered  since  the  age  of  three  so  what  type  of  strategies  techniques  have  you  employed  over  the  years  to  attain  the  eloquence  that  I'm  hearing  from  you  now?  You  don't  have  long  enough  in  this  podcast  for  me  to  outline  all  the  different  things  that  I've  tried.  I  had  speech  therapy  when  I  was  very  young  that  didn't  work.  I  got  by  in  school  and  it  was  only  really  when  I  went  to  the  grammar  school  at  the  age  of  11  and  I  have  vivid  memories  of  struggling  to  give  my  name  and  address  at  the  initial  registration  and  reading  a  shouting  class  was  a  nightmare.  And  as  the  reading  would  be  going  around  the  room  I  would  be  scanning  ahead,  10  desks  ahead  to  check  the  words  that  I  thought  I  was  going  to  have  to  say.  And  I  would  realize  that  there  were  many,  many  in  the  passages  that  I  could  not  say  and  I  would  opt  out.  So  that's  my  school  I  never  asked  nor  responded  to  questions  in  class  for  fear  of  looking  a  fool.  I  knew  the  answers  I  wanted  to  participate  but  I  kept  my  mouth  shut.  It  was  so  frustrating.  Moving  on  through  adolescence  I  didn't  have  any  further  speech  therapy.  And  then  at  the  age  of  19  when  my  hair  was  dark  and  I  didn't  have  a  wrinkle  in  sight  I  did  something  that  most  people  would  consider  idiotic  for  someone  with  a  stutter,  a  severe  stutter  because  it  was  that  severe  that  I  couldn't  say  13  letters  of  the  alphabet.  And  worse  of  all  of  course  I  couldn't  say  letters  B  which  was  a  problem  because  my  name  was  and  believe  it  or  not  it  still  is  badminton.  But  there  was  BC  D  F  G  K  L  M  N  P  S  T  and  V  I  never  ever  ever  used  and  I  became  an  expert  at  providing  synonyms  words  meaning  the  same  but  commencing  with  a  different  letter.  I  became  a  walking  thesaurus.  But  when  I  joined  the  police  service  the  only  way  in  which  I  was  able  to  gain  acceptance  was  during  the  interview.  I  very  carefully  selected  the  words  that  I  knew  I  could  say  and  I  answered  and  I  didn't  display  a  great  deal  of  stuttering  because  I  was  using  avoidance  techniques  and  I  was  accepted.  What  made  you  want  to  get  into  police  service  knowing  that  you  likely  would  have  difficulty  with  communicating?  From  a  very  early  age  Pam  I  realized  that  there  were  many  ways  that  I  could  live  my  life.  I  knew  that  I  could  take  a  relatively  easy  passage  by  avoiding  social  interaction,  by  avoiding  employment  that  didn't  require  a  great  deal  of  speaking  because  as  you  and  I  and  many  others  who  will  listen  to  this  podcast  will  know  it  is  so  easy  to  overcome  stuttering.  Yes  it  is  by  not  speaking  but  what  good  is  that  and  so  I  decided  that  I  needed  to  challenge  myself.  I  needed  to  place  myself  in  a  position  where  I  had  contact  with  the  public  and  that  is  why  I  decided  to  join  the  police  at  the  age  of  19.  Were  you  successful?  I  was  accepted  and  of  course  in  the  beginning  you  have  to  go  out  on  to  foot  patrol,  street  duties,  operational  work  and  I  relied  so  heavily  on  word  substitution  if  someone  wanted  to  know  the  time  I'd  show  them  my  watch.  If  they  wanted  directions  I'd  draw  them  on  a  piece  of  paper  and  I  would  use  word  substitution  at  all  times  but  as  you  know  every  time  you  avoid  a  word,  a  letter  or  a  situation  the  fair  level  grows  and  grows  and  grows  and  I  hid  for  so  long  but  the  time  finally  came  when  I  had  to  say  a  particular  word  I  had  to  speak  in  a  particular  situation  and  the  crunch  oh  my  gosh  I  can  remember  it  so  clearly.  The  crunch  came  for  me  Pam  when  I  had  to  give  evidence  in  court  for  the  very  first  time  and  I  can  remember  it  as  clearly  as  though  it  were  yesterday.  It's  making  me  sweat  now  I'm  beginning  to  perspire  recounting  that  experience  and  I  walked  into  the  courtroom  as  a  fresh -faced  19  year  old  with  every  eye  upon  me  and  I  stepped  up  into  the  wooden  witness  box  I  place  my  left  hand  on  the  Bible  I  raise  my  right  hand  in  the  air  and  I  said  I  sa  sa  I  I  I  I  I  sa  and  that's  as  far  as  I  got  because  the  oath  comprised  23  words  and  I  knew  well  in  advance  that  there  were  19  I  couldn't  say  and  so  I  was  filled  with  fair  intrepidation  in  the  weeks  leading  up  to  that  court  appearance  and  I  started  so  badly  that  the  only  way  in  which  I  could  say  the  oath  was  for  the  clock  of  the  court  to  repeat  the  oath  to  say  the  oath  first  of  all  and  then  ask  me  and  I  would  say  I  do  that's  all  I  had  to  say  was  I  do  it  was  a  struggle  but  there's  worse  to  come  when  you  give  evidence  in  court  you  don't  just  give  the  oath  then  came  the  evidence  in  chief  and  you  can't  and  I  relied  so  heavily  on  word  substitution  but  you  can't  change  the  defendant's  name  you  can't  change  the  date  the  time  the  place  of  the  offense  you  can't  change  the  registration  number  the  registration  mark  the  make  of  the  motor  vehicle  they're  all  non -negotiable  when  I  found  a  drunk  lying  in  Somerset  street  for  example  it  was  a  huge  temptation  Pam  to  dragging  him  or  drag  him  around  into  the  adjoining  street  before  I  made  the  arrest  into  a  street  which  didn't  start  with  one  of  my  feared  letters  and  I'm  sure  it  won't  go  any  further  than  this  conversation  but  I  did  that  on  many  many  occasions  it  was  the  only  way  in  which  I  could  exist  and  the  problems  I  had  in  court  was  so  bad  that  a  senior  officer  wrote  of  me  and  I've  still  got  this  report  to  this  very  day  he  said  when  this  officer  gives  evidence  in  court  he  is  an  embarrassment  to  all  and  I've  still  got  that  report  all  these  years  later  but  even  worse  than  that  a  couple  of  years  later  he  also  wrote  the  only  reason  that  this  officer  is  not  being  considered  for  promotion  is  his  speech  impediment  and  when  I  was  a  very  young  police  officer  I  passed  the  promotion  examination  and  I  came  third  in  the  whole  of  England  and  Wales  which  would  have  qualified  me  to  be  considered  for  a  place  at  the  prestigious  police  college  which  would  have  rocketed  me  up  through  the  ranks  I  went  for  an  interview  and  they  wouldn't  accept  me  because  of  my  speech  and  so  as  a  result  of  that  they  moved  me  indoors  they  took  me  away  from  open  operational  duties  where  I  was  an  embarrassment  and  they  put  me  in  an  administrative  role  for  many  many  years  why  did  you  stay  on  why  why  did  you  you  know  put  up  with  that  it  was  a  reasonably  well -paid  job  I  had  enjoyed  what  I  was  doing  I  had  made  many  friends  I  was  living  in  accommodation  which  was  being  provided  by  the  police  authority  there  was  a  lot  there  was  a  lot  to  give  up  if  I  had  the  chief  in  all  fairness  the  chief  officer  of  police  did  call  me  in  at  one  point  and  tell  me  that  he  would  never  promote  me  or  he  gave  me  the  option  to  seek  employment  elsewhere  because  he  recognized  that  I  had  qualities  which  I  could  use  perhaps  in  another  profession  but  I  chose  to  stay  and  as  you  will  hear  as  my  interview  progresses  it  proved  worthwhile  so  what  was  the  reaction  of  your  colleagues  once  once  once  it  became  evident  that  you  were  a  stutterer  because  you  had  avoid  it  for  so  long  and  especially  during  the  interview  we  know  now  how  your  superiors  reacted  but  what  was  what  was  it  like  with  your  colleagues  and  your  co  co  co  workers  were  they  supportive  absolutely  supportive  that  I  never  heard  an  adverse  comment  from  any  of  my  colleagues  or  immediate  supervisors  it  will  the  people  hire  up  who  were  not  working  with  me  every  day  and  when  I  spoke  to  them  my  speech  was  worse  because  I  was  trying  harder  I  was  trying  not  to  stutter  in  front  of  them  I  know  that's  the  wrong  thing  now  Pam  but  I  didn't  know  anything  about  stuttering  until  until  ten  years  ago  I  knew  nothing  about  stuttering  I  progressed  through  my  life  making  my  own  way  trying  various  therapies  and  approaches  and  in  the  end  they  all  came  together  like  a  jigsaw  and  whatever  treatment  or  therapy  we  receive  I  believe  that  we  can  take  something  from  it  and  move  on  even  though  it  might  not  be  successful  you  can  take  something  and  that's  what  I  did  and  I  tried  lots  of  things  and  one  of  the  things  which  I  utilize  for  many  years  and  it's  going  back  a  long  time  now  I  acquired  a  small  mechanical  device  called  the  Edinburgh  masker  it's  not  available  now  it's  not  available  it  was  one  of  the  very  early  prosthetic  devices  and  it  worked  on  the  principle  that  if  you  can't  hear  your  own  voice  there's  a  less  likelihood  that  you  will  stutter  and  so  every  morning  I  had  to  stick  an  adhesive  throat  microphone  underneath  my  Adam's  apple  I  could  never  ever  wear  an  open -neck  shirt  at  any  time  of  the  year  and  every  time  I  spoke  an  impulse  went  down  a  tube  into  a  control  box  which  I  which  I  wore  concealed  beneath  my  shirt  and  that  sent  a  horrendous  buzzing  sound  up  tubes  and  wires  which  went  through  my  hair  into  ear  molds  and  I  had  to  wear  my  hair  longer  than  regulation  length  to  hide  to  conceal  that  contraption  and  so  every  time  that  I  spoke  all  I  heard  was  buzz  buzz  buzz  if  someone  spoke  when  I  was  speaking  I  couldn't  hear  them  and  so  I  had  to  become  very  adept  at  lip  reading  but  it's  very  difficult  to  lip  read  someone  at  the  end  of  the  telephone  a  hundred  miles  away  and  it  was  horrendous  absolutely  horrendous  and  I  wore  that  device  this  is  going  to  surprise  you  I  wore  that  device  for  10  12  14  hours  every  day  for  the  next  20  years  Pam  20  years  I  didn't  hear  myself  speak  when  I  was  wearing  that  infernal  device  when  it  brings  tears  to  my  eyes  now  thinking  about  it  because  I  had  headaches  I  had  ear  infections  oh  it  was  a  monstrosity  but  you're  gonna  ask  me  why  did  I  persevere  are  you  going  to  ask  me  that  well  actually  my  first  question  was  how  much  would  you  estimate  that  you  spent  all  toll  on  all  the  different  devices  techniques  and  therapy  approaches  that  you  attempted  in  that  in  the  chase  to  find  fluency  more  than  half  a  century  way  more  than  half  a  century  how  much  money  well  that's  a  very  good  question  because  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  you  know  speech  therapy  is  free  of  charge  it's  free  of  charge  however  I  only  had  speech  therapy  when  I  was  young  I  purchased  the  Edinburgh  masker  out  of  my  own  pocket  and  that  was  in  1977  and  in  those  days  it  cost  about  how  can  I  translate  to  currency  which  you  will  understand  it  was  about  a  hundred  and  fifty  pounds  which  was  just  slightly  more  than  than  two  hundred  dollars  today  that  would  be  in  the  thousands  and  because  that  was  1977  yeah  okay  so  the  next  so  the  next  question  why  strange  it  never  made  me  fluent  but  I  tell  you  what  it  did  under  the  umbrella  of  that  horrific  masking  sound  it  somehow  gave  me  the  confidence  to  go  out  into  the  world  and  speaking  speaking  situations  that  I  know  I  would  otherwise  have  avoided  it  allowed  me  to  gain  very  useful  interpersonal  skills  which  sadly  many  people  who  start  a  don't  possess  and  the  reason  they  don't  possess  them  it's  not  their  fault  they  they  remain  many  of  them  on  the  fringes  of  conversation  throughout  their  life  whereas  fluent  people  if  you  want  to  use  that  expression  acquire  these  skills  from  a  very  very  early  age  I'm  not  speaking  about  fluency  I'm  talking  about  the  art  of  conversation  and  I  acquired  those  skills  and  after  about  let  me  see  after  about  five  years  of  wearing  that  device  I  persuaded  my  employers  to  allow  me  to  retain  return  to  operational  duties  and  I  went  back  out  onto  operational  duties  and  I  carried  out  normal  duties  and  I  remained  on  operational  duties  until  I  eventually  retired  but  you  mean  operational  duties  meaning  you  were  back  out  on  the  street  I  was  back  out  on  the  street  I  was  taking  charge  of  major  crime  scenes  that  became  my  role  if  there  was  a  murder  if  there  was  an  arson  if  there  was  a  rape  my  department  took  charge  of  that  crime  scene  and  as  a  result  of  attending  those  major  crime  scenes  I  had  to  liaise  with  the  forensic  science  service  with  the  police  surgeon  with  the  fire  service  with  all  different  agencies  and  I  was  able  to  do  it  albeit  in  a  strange  way  and  what  I  mean  in  a  strange  way  I  had  to  talk  rather  strangely  to  like  that  to  keep  the  device  working  it  may  have  sounded  strange  but  at  least  I  had  the  means  of  conversing  with  other  people  did  anybody  ever  remark  that  you  sounded  strange  or  why  why  why  did  you  talk  like  that  well  not  only  did  I  talk  in  a  kind  of  strange  way  but  because  I  was  wearing  this  device  and  people  couldn't  I  couldn't  hear  people  when  they  spoke  they  thought  I  was  hard  of  hearing  as  well  they  thought  I  had  hearing  impairment  oh  dear  yeah  I  know  it  was  it  was  one  heck  of  a  struggle  but  I  put  myself  out  there  I  expanded  my  comfort  zones  as  best  I  could  but  I  still  relied  so  heavily  on  word  substitution  I  did  because  at  that  time  Pam  I  didn't  realize  the  implications  of  changing  the  words  around  no  one  had  ever  told  me  that  every  time  I  changed  a  word  my  fear  of  that  word  grew  it  grew  and  grew  if  someone  had  explained  that  to  me  when  I  was  younger  I  would  have  made  a  special  effort  even  though  I  may  have  started  more  but  I  would  have  said  those  words  then  I  did  this  now  in  my  later  life  when  I  learned  about  the  implications  of  avoidance  but  no  one  told  me  that  until  11  years  ago  so  it  sounds  like  you  had  some  some  some  some  type  of  an  aha  moment  or  you  know  11  years  ago  there  something  significant  that  happened  to  change  your  mindset  for  the  sake  of  brevity  tell  us  about  it  but  in  a  brief  fashion  in  a  brief  fashion  I'd  given  up  I'd  had  a  car  accident  I  couldn't  wear  my  I  had  whiplash  injuries  I  couldn't  wear  that  device  whatsoever  my  speech  my  speech  plummeted  I  didn't  want  to  speak  to  anybody  and  if  I  was  walking  up  the  street  and  I  saw  someone  I  knew  I  would  probably  cross  over  I  vowed  that  I  would  never  again  place  myself  I  would  never  again  undertake  any  kind  of  therapy  or  approach  because  over  the  years  I'd  been  given  reasonable  degrees  of  fluency  in  a  controlled  environment  and  then  when  I'd  got  back  out  into  the  outside  world  I'd  had  them  cruelly  snatched  away  and  so  I  said  never  again  will  I  undertake  any  future  treatment  but  it  all  changed  very  very  briefly  in  April  2000  my  wife  spotted  a  notice  in  the  shop  window  advertising  a  stuttering  management  program  I'd  never  heard  of  it  I  wasn't  interested  I  wasn't  going  to  attend  but  she  very  craftily  arranged  for  us  to  be  passing  a  building  where  this  program  was  was  holding  an  open  day  and  we  drove  into  the  car  park  and  she  still  she  dragged  me  screaming  and  kicking  into  this  hall  where  I  saw  people  who  had  been  through  the  program  I  heard  them  speak  they  spoke  about  what  it  was  like  before  and  afterwards  and  I  was  very  impressed  and  as  a  result  of  that  have  I  got  time  very  quickly  to  explain  to  you  what  changed  my  mind  very  quickly  right  please  I  don't  know  how  many  people  who  will  be  listening  to  this  podcast  will  have  heard  about  the  British  athlete  Roger  Bannister  now  he's  you're  probably  too  young  to  remember  him  Pam  but  in  1954  Roger  Bannister  was  the  first  person  ever  to  run  the  mile  in  less  than  four  minutes  prior  to  that  date  athletes  worldwide  had  been  attempting  to  achieve  that  feat  it  was  considered  impossible  well  in  May  1954  he  ran  the  first  sub -4  minute  mile  the  mindset  of  athletes  changed  worldwide  they  had  evidence  that  it  could  be  achieved  within  a  year  37  other  athletes  ran  sub -4  minute  miles  the  following  year  it  increased  to  more  than  300  well  one  person  that  I  heard  speaking  at  that  Stuttering  management  open  day  he  had  spoken  about  how  he  had  won  public  speaking  competitions  and  he  was  so  in  control  of  his  speech  and  he  was  the  person  who  convinced  me  that  I  could  do  something  about  my  speech  he  became  my  Roger  Bannister  and  for  the  first  time  in  my  life  I  believe  that  I  could  do  something  about  my  speech  that  was  April  2000  in  May  I  attended  my  very  first  course  and  attending  that  course  gave  me  physiological  tools  or  rather  tools  to  deal  with  the  physiological  blips  that  were  occurring  literally  within  days  because  I  had  previously  done  work  on  my  life  because  I  had  done  many  things  because  I  had  expanded  comfort  zones  I  was  ready  and  within  days  literally  within  days  I  was  standing  up  and  I  was  in  control  of  my  speech  for  the  very  first  time  in  my  life  and  I  learned  on  the  first  day  of  that  course  the  implications  of  avoidance  and  I  made  a  pact  with  myself  Pam  that  I  would  never  again  avoid  any  word  letter  sound  or  situation  and  I  can  put  my  hand  on  my  heart  and  say  in  more  than  11  years  I  haven't  avoided  one  letter  one  sound  or  one  situation  and  that  has  been  a  tremendous  asset  in  helping  me  to  come  to  terms  with  my  stuttering  issues  so  what  was  it  actually  I  mean  what  was  it  that  worked  was  it  just  the  change  of  my  mindset  was  it  just  purely  facing  your  greatest  fears  on  that  course  they  drilled  certain  techniques  I  learned  a  new  method  of  breathing  which  virtually  helped  me  to  overcome  the  speech  block  overnight  I  then  learned  ways  of  dealing  with  those  13  letters  which  always  given  me  so  many  problems  and  so  that  course  wasn't  the  be  all  and  end  all  it  wasn't  the  final  destination  it  was  the  springboard  the  springboard  because  I  now  knew  that  I  could  have  control  of  my  speech  and  so  I  went  away  from  that  course  and  what  I  did  I  devised  my  own  plan  of  action  I  drew  up  a  plan  of  action  where  I  challenged  myself  I  expanded  my  comfort  zones  every  day  from  the  moment  I  got  up  in  the  morning  until  the  moment  I  went  to  bed  at  night  I  joined  as  public  speaking  club  no  I  tell  a  lie  I  joined  three  public  speaking  clubs  three  I  would  travel  a  hundred  miles  to  a  public  speaking  club  just  to  practice  my  new  techniques  my  new  control  I  would  pluck  three  phone  numbers  from  yellow  yellow  pages  I  would  call  them  for  two  to  three  hours  a  day  making  fictitious  inquiries  all  I  wanted  to  do  was  to  talk  talk  talk  and  I  was  doing  it  at  somebody  else's  expense  you're  a  smart  man  Alan  but  no  I  identified  myself  limiting  beliefs  and  I  challenged  those  beliefs  on  a  daily  basis  because  what  we  believe  and  how  we  see  ourselves  influences  our  thoughts  and  what  we  think  shapes  our  behaviors  so  if  you  identify  yourself  limiting  beliefs  if  you  challenge  them  or  I  challenge  them  I  became  I  acquired  more  empowering  beliefs  my  thought  became  more  empowering  my  self -image  our  self -image  sets  the  boundaries  to  our  accomplishment  it  creates  us  the  it  creates  the  scripts  by  which  we  act  out  our  lives  so  it  all  depends  on  how  you  see  yourself  if  you  can  change  your  self -image  make  it  more  empowering  enlarge  it  embrace  these  new  roles  and  the  more  I  did  these  new  roles  I  became  more  comfortable  in  doing  them  and  now  I  fully  accept  many  many  roles  that  for  so  many  years  lay  outside  my  scope  because  I  thought  I  couldn't  do  them  it  almost  seems  to  me  that  you're  a  completely  different  per  person  than  you  once  were  is  that  a  fair  presumption  I'm  always  been  a  happy  jokey  outgoing  individual  even  though  I  started  but  I  was  wearing  shackles  I  was  wearing  shackles  some  people  now  say  I  talk  too  much  Pam  to  a  charge  a  charge  to  which  I  willingly  plead  guilty  but  I  have  waited  for  more  than  50  years  to  be  able  to  say  exactly  what  I  want  to  say  the  debilitating  oral  shackles  that  inhibited  me  since  childhood  have  finally  been  removed  and  I  can  pluck  whatever  words  I  choose  from  the  extremities  of  my  vocabulary  and  say  them  without  the  fear  of  stuttering  there's  no  fear  I  still  get  the  occasional  very  occasional  reminder  but  they  are  few  and  far  between  and  yes  I  am  a  much  more  assertive  individual  you  have  to  become  I  believe  more  assertive  but  the  danger  if  that  is  the  word  that  when  we  become  more  assertive  when  we  change  the  people  with  whom  we  live  our  partners  our  wives  our  husband  now  see  are  now  living  with  a  different  human  being  it's  they  are  not  the  people  that  they  possibly  fell  in  love  with  and  the  roles  which  we  have  or  the  roles  which  I  had  when  I  studied  they  changed  there  were  many  instances  where  my  my  wife  would  help  out  make  telephone  calls  on  my  behalf  order  for  me  at  a  restaurant  the  moment  I  came  home  from  that  course  on  the  fourth  of  May  2000  I  explained  to  her  thank  you  for  everything  that  you  have  done  thank  you  for  all  the  support  that  you've  given  me  over  the  years  but  please  from  now  on  I  must  accept  responsibility  for  every  speaking  situation  that  I  have  to  perform  if  I  hadn't  explained  she  may  have  felt  a  little  redundant  she  was  so  so  understanding  we  have  a  wonderful  wonderful  relationship  but  I  have  seen  people  change  and  have  problems  with  their  relationships  because  change  changes  everything  you're  not  the  person  the  roles  which  you  have  fulfilled  the  boundaries  the  guidelines  they  change  mm -hmm  and  so  you  need  to  consult  you  need  to  share  you  need  to  speak  otherwise  I  know  from  other  people  that  it  has  caused  them  problems  thankfully  it  hasn't  caused  any  problems  in  our  household  whatsoever  because  my  wife  has  been  so  so  supportive  and  I  just  like  to  say  she  didn't  twist  my  arm  to  go  on  that  course  because  she  didn't  love  me  as  I  was  she  did  that  because  she  knew  that  I  had  had  to  accept  second  best  for  so  much  of  my  life  and  she  knew  that  I  would  be  happier  fulfilling  my  true  potential  and  that  is  why  she  poked  me  to  attend  that  course  in  2000  sounds  like  it  was  the  very  best  thing  that  you  that  that  that  the  very  best  gift  that  she  gave  you  yes  but  I  had  to  move  on  from  that  course  although  that  course  provided  wonderful  support  I  took  that  support  for  a  while  but  I  knew  that  if  I  if  I  really  wanted  to  deal  wholly  with  my  stuttering  issues  not  just  in  a  course  environment  not  just  at  a  support  group  I  knew  that  I  had  to  take  responsibility  for  the  rest  of  my  life  and  so  I  have  moved  away  from  that  course  in  recent  years  but  the  support  which  it  provided  is  wonderful  but  I  chose  to  move  on  let  me  ask  you  this  just  to  stray  a  little  bit  away  with  your  with  your  very  fluent  communication  these  days  what's  it  like  for  for  you  when  you  interact  or  speak  with  other  people  who  stutter  who  have  not  achieved  that  level  of  confidence  and  fluency  does  it  make  you  uncomfortable  to  listen  to  other  people  that  are  still  stuttering  does  it  make  you  want  to  suggest  to  them  that  they  try  some  some  some  some  of  the  techniques  that  have  worked  for  you  no  I  recognize  that  we  are  all  different  human  beings  we  commence  from  different  starting  lines  we  have  different  life  experiences  we  have  different  amounts  of  emotional  baggage  we  have  different  aspirations  and  hopes  in  life  I  would  never  ever  ever  ever  attempt  to  coerce  anyone  to  follow  in  my  footpath  it  worked  for  me  it  worked  for  me  I  would  never  ever  dream  of  telling  anyone  hey  you  should  do  this  no  no  no  I  will  willingly  share  my  experiences  as  I  am  here  I  still  belong  to  the  international  telephone  support  network  which  is  provided  by  that  stuttering  management  program  although  I  no  longer  attend  their  courses  I  no  longer  attend  their  support  groups  I  still  support  people  who  are  coming  through  via  that  international  support  network  and  I  speak  every  day  to  10  12  15  I  have  spoken  to  as  many  as  30  different  people  on  one  day  it's  all  done  completely  free  of  charge  without  I  do  it  because  I  received  that  help  when  I  needed  it  no  I  speak  to  people  who  still  stutter  very  severely  every  day  it  doesn't  register  with  me  whatsoever  I  was  in  that  position  myself  not  so  long  ago  why  should  I  look  down  on  them  I  it's  just  how  they  speak  and  I  wasn't  so  suggesting  that  you  would  look  down  on  and  on  and  anybody  else  who  has  not  achieved  the  fluency  that  you  have  certainly  that's  not  what  I  was  suggesting  I  was  just  you  know  trying  to  find  out  if  you  know  sometimes  it  might  seem  natural  like  to  just  say  to  somebody  hey  try  this  it  worked  for  me  you  know  and  it  sounds  like  you  know  you  share  your  story  but  you  share  it  with  just  an  interest  in  sharing  for  the  sake  of  sharing  and  not  necessarily  suggesting  or  as  you  put  coercing  anybody  to  try  something  because  you're  right  I  mean  we're  all  unique  and  what  works  for  one  perhaps  will  not  work  for  for  for  for  another  and  there  is  no  cookie -cutter  approach  to  take  with  this  thing  that  we  deal  with  known  as  stuttering  they  are  people  who  have  improved  their  fluency  who  try  to  coerce  others  I  know  that  it  can  cause  friction  I  would  never  ever  I  have  never  done  that  and  I  would  never  ever  ever  consider  doing  it  in  my  lifetime  well  that's  that's  you  know  that's  important  because  you  know  the  stuttering  community  is  vast  and  we're  all  so  different  and  each  of  our  unique  stories  contributes  to  the  community  that  we  can  take  take  take  take  a  little  bit  from  here  a  little  bit  from  there  and  I  just  firmly  believe  that  just  simply  sharing  our  stories  with  each  other  make  make  make  make  make  make  make  makes  a  big  difference  I  agree  yes  I  over  the  last  10  years  I  have  spoken  to  more  than  400  different  organizations  in  an  attempt  to  create  greater  public  awareness  about  stuttering  the  majority  of  those  groups  are  not  people  who  stutter  but  there  are  always  people  in  those  groups  who  come  to  me  at  the  end  of  my  talk  or  even  stand  up  when  I  conduct  the  question  and  answers  at  the  end  and  they  say  what  you  have  spoken  about  identifying  your  self -limiting  beliefs  expanding  your  comfort  zones  facing  your  fears  living  life  to  the  full  that  applies  to  everyone  and  they  tell  me  that  they  are  heartened  and  inspired  by  what  I  speak  about  because  it  doesn't  just  relate  to  people  who  stutter  I've  spoken  to  people  who  are  hard  of  hearing  I've  spoken  to  people  who  have  Parkinson's  disease  I  have  spoken  to  people  who  have  cancer  and  they  all  tell  me  the  same  that's  dealing  with  stuttering  is  very  much  like  dealing  with  problems  which  people  other  people  have  in  their  lives  although  I  know  and  I  fully  understand  that  that  may  be  difficult  for  people  who  stutter  to  understand  that  other  people  have  very  similar  issues  in  their  lives  in  fact  other  people  people  have  more  serious  debilitating  issues  than  stuttering  yes  yes  they  have  hey  I  was  hoping  you  were  going  to  ask  me  to  recite  the  poem  which  which  explains  to  people  the  implications  of  avoidance  because  I  think  it  is  so  important  and  I  never  ever  had  this  when  I  was  younger  and  so  if  there  is  time  please  please  please  I'm  on  my  knees  pleading  with  you  if  there  is  time  could  I  share  it  with  others  I'll  make  you  a  deal  we'll  do  that  at  the  end  and  we  are  approaching  the  end  but  okay  I  did  want  to  ask  you  you  asked  me  at  one  time  could  could  could  could  could  you  be  an  honorary  woman  on  my  podcast  I  beg  your  pardon  yes  yes  you  did  I  did  say  and  I'm  curious  why  did  did  did  you  want  to  come  on  to  you  know  have  a  conversation  with  me  that  that  that  would  be  publicized  what  was  the  draw  one  I  love  challenges  I  still  set  myself  goals  every  day  the  most  bizarre  challenge  the  greater  the  satisfaction  I  derived  so  it  was  expanding  my  comfort  zones  it  was  a  new  challenge  to  I  like  having  the  opportunity  to  share  my  story  not  to  say  to  people  hey  this  is  what  I  have  done  I  truly  believe  that  when  we  share  our  stories  there  may  be  people  out  there  who  may  pick  up  on  even  one  small  aspect  of  what  the  person  has  to  say  and  that  may  be  sufficient  to  help  them  to  progress  a  little  bit  further  and  another  thing  is  I  truly  believe  that  speaking  about  our  own  experiences  is  not  in  any  way  egotistical  I  truly  believe  that  when  we  bring  these  positive  experiences  back  into  our  minds  it  strengthens  our  memories  of  those  experiences  and  for  so  long  for  so  long  I  had  so  many  negative  experiences  and  I  replayed  those  negative  outlooks  over  and  over  so  now  I  reversed  it  the  worm  has  turned  I  now  remind  myself  of  the  things  that  I  have  achieved  in  life  and  if  along  the  way  someone  takes  just  one  little  point  or  two  little  points  from  that  journey  then  it  would  make  it  for  me  all  worthwhile  thank  you  for  sharing  that  and  to  wrap  up  this  great  con  con  con  con  conversation  please  do  share  your  poem  with  us  it's  a  poem  entitled  changing  the  words  around  and  you've  guessed  it's  by  Alan  badminton  I  couldn't  say  muffin  I  couldn't  say  butter  if  I  ordered  a  burger  I'd  stumble  and  star  star  stutter  so  instead  of  me  saying  the  words  that  I  should  I'd  swap  them  for  others  I  hoped  that  I  could  but  you  can't  always  leave  out  the  words  that  you  dread  there  are  times  when  a  certain  thing  has  to  be  said  my  sisters  called  Sarah  my  best  friend  is  Ben  they  just  wouldn't  answer  to  Lucy  and  Len  whenever  I  spotted  a  difficult  sound  I'd  hastily  juggle  my  sentence  around  I  spent  so  much  energy  word  rearranging  whenever  I  spoke  I  was  chopping  and  changing  my  efforts  to  search  for  an  easier  word  resulted  in  sentences  sometimes  absurd  at  times  my  selections  just  didn't  make  sense  which  made  me  more  anxious  frustrated  and  tense  each  time  I  avoided  a  troublesome  sound  I  felt  rather  guilty  and  very  soon  found  that  my  fear  of  speaking  increased  even  more  the  number  of  problem  words  started  to  soar  in  time  I  discovered  that  word  substitution  was  simply  avoidance  and  not  a  solution  although  I  was  fluent  or  so  it  appeared  the  words  I  avoided  became  much  more  feared  one  day  I  decided  enough  was  enough  I  made  myself  promise  although  it  was  tough  to  say  what  I  wanted  whatever  the  letter  at  times  I  still  struggled  but  I  felt  so  much  better  today  I  will  say  any  letter  or  sound  confronting  my  fears  is  the  best  way  I  found  should  I  ever  be  tempted  to  waver  some  time  I'll  remember  the  message  contained  in  this  rhyme  and  that's  it  Pam  oh  that  was  beautiful  and  that  was  a  per  perfect  way  to  end  this  wonderful  con  con  con  conversation  that  we've  had  I  want  to  thank  you  for  sharing  and  being  a  guest  on  this  inaugural  episode  again  thank  you  for  your  honesty  and  your  willingness  to  share  your  story  thank  you  for  allowing  me  to  go  boldly  where  no  man  has  previously  gone  perfect  and  this  has  been  his  stories  she  asks  him\n"
