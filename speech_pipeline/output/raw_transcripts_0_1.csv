He_Stutters_Podcast_–_Make_Room_For_The_Stuttering, episode-208-with-kelsey-h, https://stutterrockstar.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/male-episode-1-with-alan1.mp3,0,en,"Hi everybody, this is Pam coming to you from the debut episode of a new addition to the blog Make Room For This Stuttering. Today I'm going to introduce his stories. She asks him. And my goal is to introduce a little bit of the male perspective on this crazy thing that we all know as stuttering. So for my debut male guest, I'm really excited to say hello to Alan. Hi Alan, how are you? Good afternoon. It's good afternoon here in Wales in the United Kingdom. I suspect it's still morning with you or just into the afternoon in the New York area. That is correct. It's just it's a yep it's just past noon time and it's a beautiful Saturday afternoon here kind of chilly but it's one of those days where I don't mind at all staying in talking with good friends and probably later on getting some housework done. Good for you. So Alan, for our listeners could you formally introduce yourself, your name and again where you're from and what you do with yourself these days? I will introduce myself even though as you know I'm a shy and retiring guy. My name is Alan Badminton and I'll spell that because everybody spells it incorrectly. B-A-D-M-I-N-G-T-O-N. Everybody leaves out the G. And I'm from Wales in the United Kingdom and Wales just to give you a brief geographical lesson, Wales is one of the four countries that make up the United Kingdom along with England, Scotland and Northern Ireland and so I live in Wales. I've always lived in Wales and I've lived here for quite a long time because I'm getting quite long in the tooth. Okay and I've started I'm so sorry I interrupted you I was just going to say I've started since the very early age of three. And you speak obviously very clearly and very fluidly as we're hearing you. You've stuttered since the age of three so what type of strategies, techniques have you employed over the years to attain the eloquence that I'm hearing from you now? You don't have long enough in this podcast for me to outline all the different things that I've tried. I had speech therapy when I was very young that didn't work. I got by in school and it was only really when I went to the grammar school at the age of 11 and I have vivid memories of struggling to give my name and address at the initial registration and reading aloud in class was a nightmare and as the reading would be going around the room I would be scanning ahead 10 desks ahead to check the words that I thought I was going to have to say and I would realize that they there were many many in the passages that I could not say and I would opt out. So that's my school I never asked nor responded to questions in class for fear of looking a fool. I knew the answers I wanted to participate but I kept my mouth shut. It was so frustrating. Moving on through adolescence I didn't have any further speech therapy and then at the age of 19 when my hair was dark and I didn't have a wrinkle in sight I did something that most people would consider idiotic for someone with a stutter a severe stutter because it was that severe that I couldn't say 13 letters of the alphabet and worse of all of course I couldn't say letters B which was a problem because my name was and believe it or not it still is badminton but there was B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, S, T and V I never ever ever used and I became an expert at providing synonyms words meaning the same but commencing with a different letter. I became a walking thesaurus but when I joined the police service the only way in which I was able to gain acceptance was during the interview I very carefully selected the words that I knew I could say and I answered and I didn't display a great deal of stuttering because I was using avoidance techniques and I was accepted what made you what made you want to get into police service knowing that you likely would have difficulty with communicating from a very early age Pam I realized that there were many ways that I could live my life I knew that I could take a relatively easy passage by avoiding social interaction by avoiding employment that didn't require a great deal of speaking because as you and I and many others who will listen to this podcast will know it is so easy to overcome stuttering yes it is by not speaking but what good is that and so I decided that I needed to challenge myself I needed to place myself in a position where I had contact with the public and that is why I decided to join the police at the age of 19 were you successful I was accepted and of course in the beginning you have to go out onto foot patrol street duties operational work and I relied so heavily on word substitution if someone wanted to know the time I'd show them my watch if they wanted directions I'd draw them on a piece of paper and I would use word substitution at all times but as you know every time you avoid a word a letter or a situation the fair level grows and grows and I hid for so long but the time finally came when I had to say a particular word I had to speak in a particular situation and the crunch oh my gosh I can remember it so clearly the crunch came for me Pam when when I had to give evidence in court for the very first time and I can remember it as clearly as though it were yesterday it's making me sweat now I'm beginning to perspire recounting that experience and I walked into the courtroom as a fresh-faced 19-year-old with every eye upon me and I stepped up into the wooden witness box I placed my left hand on the Bible I raised my right hand in the air and I said I and that's as far as I got because the oath comprised 23 words and I knew well in advance that they were 19 I couldn't say and so I was filled with fair intrepidation in the weeks leading up to that court appearance and I started so badly that the only way in which I could say the oath was for the clock of the court to repeat the oath to say the oath first of all and then ask me and I would say I do that's all I had to say was I do it was a struggle but there's worse to come when you give evidence in court you don't just give the oath then came the evidence in chief and you can't and I relied so heavily on word substitution but you can't change the defendant's name you can't change the date the time the place of the offense you can't change the registration number the registration mark the make of the motor vehicle they're all non-negotiable when I found a drunk lying in Somerset street for example it was a huge temptation Pam to dragging him drag him around into the adjoining street before I made the arrest into a street which didn't start with one of my feared letters and I'm sure it won't go any further than this conversation but I did that on many many occasions it was the only way in which I could exist and the problems I had in court was so bad that a senior officer wrote of me and I've still got this report to this very day he said when this officer gives evidence in court he is an embarrassment to all and I've still got that report all these years later but even worse than that a couple of years later he also wrote the only reason that this officer is not being considered for promotion is his speech impediment and when I was a very young police officer I passed the promotion examination and I came third in the whole of England and Wales which would have qualified me to be considered for a place at the prestigious police college which would have rocketed me up through the ranks I went for an interview and they wouldn't accept me because of my speech and so as a result of that they moved me indoors they took me away from open operational duties where I was an embarrassment and they put me in an administrative role for many many years why did you stay on why why did you you know put up with that it was a reasonably well paid job I had enjoyed what I was doing I had made many friends I was living in accommodation which was being provided by the police authority there was a lot there was a lot to give up if I had the chief in all fairness the chief officer of police did call me in at one point and tell me that he would never promote me or he gave me the option to seek employment elsewhere because he recognized that I had qualities which I could use perhaps in another profession but I chose to stay and as you will hear as my interview progresses it proved worthwhile so what was the reaction of your colleagues once once once it became evident that you were a stutterer because you had avoided for so long and especially during the interview we know now how your superiors reacted but what was what was it like with your colleagues and your co co co co workers were they supportive absolutely supportive that I never heard an adverse comment from any of my colleagues or immediate supervisors it was the people higher up who were not working with me every day and when I spoke to them my speech was worse because I was trying harder I was trying not to stutter in front of them I know that's the wrong thing now Pam but I didn't know anything about stuttering until until 10 years ago I knew nothing about stuttering I progressed through my life making my own way trying various therapies and approaches and in the end they all came together like a jigsaw and whatever treatment or therapy we receive I believe that we can take something from it and move on even though it might not be successful you can take something and that's what I did and I tried lots of things and one of the things which I utilized for many years and it's going back a long time now I acquired a small mechanical device called the Edinburgh masker it's not available now it's not available it was one of the very early prosthetic devices and it worked on the principle that if you can't hear your own voice there's a less likelihood that you will stutter and so every morning I had to stick an adhesive throat microphone underneath my Adam's apple I could never ever wear an open neck shirt at any time of the year and every time I spoke an impulse went down a tube into a control box which I which I wore concealed beneath my shirt and that sent a horrendous buzzing sound up tubes and wires which went through my hair into ear molds and I had to wear my hair longer than regulation length too high to conceal that contraption and so every time that I spoke all I heard was buzz buzz buzz if someone spoke when I was speaking I couldn't hear them and so I had to become very adept at lip reading but it's very difficult to lip read someone at the end of the telephone a hundred miles away it and it was horrendous absolutely horrendous and I wore that device this is going to surprise you I wore that device for 10 12 14 hours every day for the next 20 years Pam 20 years I didn't hear myself speak when I was wearing that infernal device when it brings tears to my eyes now thinking about it because I had headaches I had ear infections oh it was a monstrosity but you're gonna ask me why did I persevere are you going to ask me that well actually my first question was how much would you estimate that you spent all toll on all the different devices techniques and therapy approaches that you attempted in that in the chase to find fluency more than half a century way more than half a century bam how much money well that's a very good question because in the United Kingdom as you know speech therapy is free of charge it's free of charge however I only had speech therapy when I was young I purchased the Edinburgh masker out of my own pocket and that was in 1977 and in those days it cost about how can I translate to currency which you will understand it was about 150 pounds which was just slightly more than than 200 dollars today that would be in the thousands and thousands because that was 1977 yeah okay so the so the next question why strange it never made me fluent but I tell you what it did under the umbrella of that horrific masking sound it somehow gave me the confidence to go out into the world and speaking speaking situations that I know I would otherwise have avoided it allowed me to gain very useful interpersonal skills which sadly many people who start to don't possess and the reason they don't possess them it's not their fault they they remain many of them on the fringes of conversation throughout their life whereas fluent people if you want to use that expression acquire these skills from a very very early age I'm not speaking about fluency I'm talking about the art of conversation and I acquired those skills and after about let me see after about five years of wearing that device I persuaded my employers to allow me to retain return to operational duties and I went back out onto operational duties and I carried out normal duties and I remained on operational duties until I eventually retired but you mean operational duties meaning you were back out on the street I was back out on the street I was taking charge of major crime scenes that became my role if there was a murder if there was an arson if there was a rape my department took charge of that crime scene and as a result of attending those major crime scenes I had to liaise with the forensic science service with the police surgeon with the fire service with all different agencies and I was able to do it albeit in a strange way and what I mean in a strange way I had to talk rather strangely to like that to keep the device working it may have sounded strange but at least I had the means of conversing with other people did anybody ever remark that you sounded strange or why why did you talk like that well not only did I talk in a kind of strange way but because I was wearing this device and people couldn't I couldn't hear people when they spoke they thought I was hard of hearing as well they thought I had hearing impairment oh dear yeah I know it was it was one heck of a struggle but I put myself out there I expanded my comfort zones as best I could but I still relied so heavily on word substitution I did because at that time Pam I didn't realize the implications of changing the words around no one had ever told me that every time I changed a word my fear of that word grew it grew and grew if someone had explained that to me when I was younger I would have made a special effort even though I may have started more but I would have said those words then I did this now in my later life when I learned about the implications of avoidance but no one told me that until 11 years ago so it sounds like you had some some some some type of a an aha moment or you know 11 years ago there was something significant that happened to change your mindset for the sake of brevity um tell us about it but in a brief fashion in a brief fashion I'd given up I'd had a car accident I couldn't wear my I had whiplash injuries I couldn't wear that device whatsoever my speech my speech plummeted I didn't want to speak to anybody and if I was walking up the street and I saw someone I knew I would probably cross over I vowed that I would never again place myself I would never again undertake any kind of therapy or approach because over the years I'd been given reasonable degrees of fluency in a controlled environment and then when I'd got back out into the outside world I'd had them cruelly snatched away and so I said never again will I undertake any future treatment but it all changed very very briefly in April 2000 my wife spotted a notice in a shop window advertising a stuttering management program I'd never heard of it I wasn't interested I wasn't going to attend but she very craftily arranged for us to be passing a building where this program was was holding an open day and we drove into the car park and she still she dragged me screaming and kicking into this hall where I saw people who had been through the program I heard them speak they spoke about what it was like before and afterwards and I was very impressed and as a result of that have I got time very quickly to explain to you what changed my mind very quickly right please I don't know how many people who will be listening to this podcast will have heard about the British athlete Roger Bannister now he's you're probably too young to remember him Pam but in 1954 Roger Bannister was the first person ever to run the mile in less than four minutes prior to that date athletes worldwide had been attempting to achieve that feat it was considered impossible well in May 1954 he ran the first sub four minute mile the mindset of athletes changed worldwide they had evidence that it could be achieved within a year 37 other athletes ran sub four minute miles the following year it increased to more than 300 well one person that I heard speaking at that stuttering management open day he had spoken about how he had won public speaking competitions and he was so in control of his speech and he was the person who convinced me that I could do something about my speech he became my Roger Bannister and for the first time in my life I believed that I could do something about my speech that was April 2000 in May I attended my very first course and attending that course gave me physiological tools or rather tools to deal with the physiological blips that were occurring literally within days because I had previously done work on my life because I had done many things because I had expanded comfort zones I was ready and within days literally within days I was standing up and I was in control of my speech for the very first time in my life and I learned on the first day of that course the implications of avoidance and I made a pact with myself Pam that I would never again avoid any word letter sound or situation and I can put my hand on my heart and say in more than 11 years I haven't avoided one letter one sound or one situation and that has been a tremendous asset in helping me to come to terms with my stuttering issues so what was it actually I mean what was it that worked was it just the change of my mindset was it just purely facing your greatest fears on that course they drilled certain techniques I learned a new method of breathing which virtually helped me to overcome the speech block overnight I then learned ways of dealing with those 13 letters which had always given me so many problems and so that course wasn't the be all and end all it wasn't the final destination it was the springboard the springboard because I now knew that I could have control of my speech and so I went away from that course and what I did I devised my own plan of action I drew up a plan of action where I challenged myself I expanded my comfort zones every day from the moment I got up in the morning until the moment I went to bed at night I joined a public speaking club no I tell a lie I joined three public speaking clubs three I would travel a hundred miles to a public speaking club just to practice my new techniques my new control I would pluck three phone numbers from yellow yellow pages I would call them for two to three hours a day making fictitious inquiries all I wanted to do was to talk talk talk and I was doing it at somebody else's expense you're a smart man Alan but no I identified myself limiting beliefs and I challenged those beliefs on a daily basis because what we believe and how we see ourselves influences our thoughts and what we think shapes our behaviors so if you identify yourself limiting beliefs if you challenge them or I challenge them I became I acquired more empowering beliefs my thought became more empowering my self image our self image sets the boundaries to our accomplishment it creates it creates the scripts by which we act out our lives so it all depends on how you see yourself if you can change your self image make it more empowering enlarge it embrace these new roles and the more I did these new roles I became more comfortable in doing them and now I fully accept many many roles that for so many years lay outside my scope because I thought I couldn't do them it almost seems to me that you're a completely different per person than you once were is that a fair presumption I've always been a happy jokie outgoing individual even though I started it but I was wearing shackles I was wearing shackles some people now say I talk too much Pam to a charge a charge to which I willingly plead guilty but I have waited for more than 50 years to be able to say exactly what I want to say the debilitating oral shackles that inhibited me since childhood have finally been removed and I can pluck whatever words I choose from the extremities of my vocabulary and say them without the fear of stuttering there's no fear I still get the occasional very occasional reminder but they are few and far between and yes I am a much more assertive individual you have to become I believe more assertive but the danger if that is the word that when we become more assertive when we change the people with whom we live our partners our wives our husband now see are now living with a different human being it's they are not the people that they possibly fell in love with and the roles which we have or the roles which I had when I studied they changed there were many instances where my my wife would help out make telephone calls on my behalf order for me at a restaurant the moment I came home from that course on the 4th of May 2000 I explained to her thank you for everything that you have done thank you for all the support that you've given me over the years but please from now on I must accept responsibility for every speaking situation that I have to perform if I hadn't explained she may have felt a little redundant she was so so understanding we have a wonderful wonderful relationship but I have seen people change and have problems with their relationships because change changes everything you're not the person the roles which you have fulfilled the boundaries the guidelines they change and so you need to consult you need to share you need to speak otherwise I know from other people that it has caused them problems thankfully it hasn't caused any problems in our household whatsoever because my wife has been so so supportive and I just like to say she didn't twist my arm to go on that course because she didn't love me as I was she did that because she knew that I had had to accept second best for so much of my life and she knew that I would be happier fulfilling my true potential and that is why she poked me to attend that course in 2000 sounds like it was the very best thing that you that that that the very best gift that she gave you yes but I had to move on from that course although that course provided wonderful support I took that support for a while but I knew that if I if I really wanted to deal wholly with my stuttering issues not just in a course environment not just at a support group I knew that I had to take responsibility for the rest of my life and so I have moved away from that course in recent years but the support which it provided is wonderful but I chose to move on let me ask you this just to stray a little bit away with your with your very fluent communication these days what's it like for for for for you when you interact or speak with other people who stutter who have not achieved that level of confidence and fluency does it make you uncomfortable to listen to other people that are still stuttering does it make you want to suggest to them that they try some some some some of the techniques that have worked for you no I recognize that we are all different human beings we commence from different starting lines we have different life experiences we have different amounts of emotional baggage we have different aspirations and hopes in life I would never ever ever ever attempt to coerce anyone to follow in my footpath it worked for me it worked for me I would never ever dream of telling anyone hey you should do this no no no I will willingly share my experiences as I am here I still belong to the international telephone support network which is provided by that stuttering management program although I no longer attend their courses I no longer attend their support groups I still support people who are coming through via that international support network and I speak every day to 10 12 15 I have spoken to as many as 30 different people on one day it's all done completely free of charge without I do it because I received that help when I needed it no I speak to people who still stutter very severely every day it doesn't register with me whatsoever I was in that position myself not so long ago why should I look down on them I it's just how they speak and I wasn't so suggesting that you would look down on and on and anybody else who has not achieved the fluency that you have certainly that's not what I was suggesting I was just uh you know trying to find out if you know sometimes it might seem natural like to just say this somebody hey try this it worked for me you know and it sounds like you know you share your story but you share it with just an interest in sharing for the sake of sharing and not necessarily um suggesting or as you put coercing anybody to try something because you're right I mean we're all unique and what works for one perhaps will not work for for for for another and there is no cookie cutter approach to take with this thing that we deal with known as stuttering there are people who have improved their fluency who try to coerce others mm-hmm I know that it can cause friction I would never ever I have never done that and I would never ever ever consider doing it in my lifetime well that's that's you know that's important because you know the stuttering co co co co community is vast and we're all so different and each of our unique stories contributes to the community that we can take take take take a little bit from here a little bit from there and I just firmly believe that just simply sharing our stories with each other make make make make make makes a big difference I agree yes I over the last 10 years I have spoken to more than 400 different organizations in an attempt to create greater public awareness about stuttering the majority of those groups are not people who stutter but there are always people in those groups who come to me at the end of my talk or even stand up when I conduct the question and answers at the end and they say what you have spoken about identifying your self-limiting beliefs expanding your comfort zones facing your fears living life to the full that applies to everyone and they tell me that they are heartened and inspired by what I speak about because it doesn't just relate to people who stutter I've spoken to people who are heart of hearing I've spoken to people who have Parkinson's disease I've spoken to people who have cancer and they all tell me the same that dealing with stuttering is very much like dealing with problems which people other people have in their lives although I know and I fully understand that that may be difficult for people who stutter to understand that other people have very similar issues in their lives and in fact other people people have more serious debilitating issues than stuttering yes yes they have hey I was hoping you were going to ask me to recite the poem which which explains to people the implications of avoidance because I think it is so important and I never ever had this when I was younger and so if there is time please please please I'm on my knees pleading with you if there is time could I share it with others I'll make you a deal we'll do that at the end and we are approaching the end but I okay I did want to ask you um you asked me at one time could could could could could you be an honorary woman on my podcast I beg your pardon you asked me yes yes you did I did say and I'm curious um um why did did did did you want to um come on to you know have a conversation with me that that that that would be publicized what was the draw one I love challenges I still set myself goals every day the most bizarre challenge the greater the satisfaction I derive so it was expanding my comfort zones it was a new challenge two I like having the opportunity to share my story not to say to people hey this is what I have done I truly believe that when we share our stories there may be people out there who may pick up on even one small aspect of what the person has to say and that may be sufficient to help them to progress a little bit further and another thing is I truly believe that speaking about our own experiences is not in any way egotistical I truly believe that when we bring these positive experiences back into our minds it strengthens our memories of those experiences and for so long for so long I had so many negative experiences and I replayed those negative outlooks over and over so now I've reversed it the worm has turned I now remind myself of the things that I have achieved in life and if along the way hey someone takes just one little point or two little points from that journey then it would make it for me all worthwhile thank you for sharing that and to wrap up this great con con con con conversation please do share your poem with us it's a poem entitled changing the words around and you've guessed it's by Alan badminton I couldn't say muffin I couldn't say butter if I ordered a burger I'd stumble and star star stutter so instead of me saying the words that I should I'd swap them for others I hoped that I could but you can't always leave out the words that you dread there are times when a certain thing has to be said my sister's called Sarah my best friend is Ben they just wouldn't answer to Lucy and Len whenever I spotted a difficult sound I'd hastily juggle my sentence around I spent so much energy word rearranging whenever I spoke I was chopping and changing my efforts to search for an easier word resulted in sentences sometimes absurd at times my selections just didn't make sense which made me more anxious frustrated and tense each time I avoided a troublesome sound I felt rather guilty and very soon found that my fear of speaking increased even more the number of problem words started to soar in time I discovered that word substitution was simply avoidance and not a solution although I was fluent or so it appeared the words I avoided became much more feared one day I decided enough was enough I made myself promise although it was tough to say what I wanted whatever the letter at times I still struggled but I felt so much better today I will say any letter or sound confronting my fears is the best way I found should I ever be tempted to waver some time I'll remember the message contained in this rhyme and that's it Pam oh that was beautiful and that was a perfect way to end this wonderful con con con conversation that we've had I want to thank you for sharing and being a guest on this inaugural episode again thank you for your honesty and your willingness to share your story thank you for allowing me to go boldly when no man has previously gone oh perfect and uh this has been his stories she asks him"

You can find the podcast directly linked to the blog, Make Room for the Stuttering, and it's also freely downloadable on iTunes. Today I have the privilege and the opportunity to speak to a guy that I've only really said hi and bye to at some of the National Stuttering Association conferences, so I'm really excited to get to know him a little bit better, so please welcome me and say hello to Landon. Hey Landon, how's it going? Hello, how are you? Good, good, I'm enjoying a nice sunny peaceful day so far on a weekend, and how about you? It is very nice here. It's like super blue skies, so that's always nice. Awesome, awesome. So to get us started, would you formally introduce yourself to us, tell us who you are, where you're from, and what you do to keep yourself busy? Okay, well, I'm Landon DeMurray from New Orleans. I am in school for process engineering, and I'm also the New Orleans chapter leader of the National Stuttering Association here in New Orleans. I've been doing that for about two years now. I didn't realize that you were a chapter leader. That's pretty cool. How did you get involved in that? I lived in Lafayette for like two years because my fiance was at a school there, and one day it's a really interesting story actually. One day she was at school and she goes, she's walking around campus, and the NSA chapter there was doing like an info booth, and I'm sure you've met John Tedinowski. I know of him, and I've listened to him at workshops, but I've never actually met him, no. Super, super awesome guy. He was in charge of the chapter, and she was like, I'm going to ask them what this is about, and she told them all about me, and they were like, you have to get him to come to a group. So she came home that afternoon and was like, have you ever heard of this thing called the NSA? I was like, no. And then she was like, we are going to go to a group tomorrow night. And to be honest, I was at the point with my speech that I was completely comfortable, but I assumed that it would be more therapy, which is something I was not interested in at all. And my fiance is very forgetful, so the day of the group, I of course am like counting down the hours, I don't want to go. And she didn't bring it up until like an hour before, and she's like, are we going? I'm like, I don't want to. She's like, no, we're going to go just once and see how it is. And to be honest, that one group changed my whole life, like the next day she emailed Tammy and told her about our time at the support group and explained that we wouldn't, you know, that we'd like to go to a conference, but that we couldn't afford it and Tammy basically paid for everything. And that first year changed both of us. And then I moved to New Orleans and I was in the group there for like a year and a half. And after the Cleveland conference, I just felt the need to like give more. So I took the steps and I asked the guy who was in charge if I could perhaps, you know, try it. Yeah, of course. And then that was two years ago when I took over we had, we had two or three who came every month and now we're up to around eight. Oh, wow. And what do you, what do you attribute that in, in, in increase to? Well, I mean, I'm, I really tried to tell everyone. And that I meet who I think can get something out of the group about the group. And I do, we've done some like info booths and we've had a few events, you know, I'm just trying to get our name out there as much as we can because the group helped me so much. And we have guys who are coming to groups now who I can tell, you know, it, it just makes a really big difference. So I wouldn't say it's all me, but I'm, I definitely tried my best and some just naturally find the group. So I think it just depends. How do you guys advertise? Oh, as of now, we don't really advertise that much. I've tried countless times to like get us mentioned on the news or like commercials, it hasn't really worked that much. Most of the new guys in our group and just they found the NSA site and they found where the groups are and they've just like shut up. Oh, I see. And you keep saying guys are the, are the, are the members mostly are no, are the men, are the men, are the members that attend? Are they most mostly guys? I would say no, we have, we have three or four girls who come. So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I actually usually have about half and half. I think I'm just saying guys as a general, generalization. Yeah, I'm just teasing it kind of. But when I was going to support group meetings here in, in, in, in New York for a while, I don't anymore. But I sometimes found myself the only woman with like 10 or 12 guys. And I sometimes felt really uncomfortable with that. Like always being the only woman there. So it's good to hear that you kind of have a mixed group. I think that's really important. Yeah. Um, what was it about that first meeting that your girl, your girl friend, now fiance kind of dragged you to what, what, what, what, what was it that like changed your life? Well, I, like I said, I was not interested in more. Therapy at all. Cause it just, you know, didn't work for me. And I think she was just trying to, you know, I think she was just trying to see how this would work. And up until that point, I hadn't met anyone else who stuttered. Oh, wow. So, you know, so going to that first group and seeing, you know, I think part of it was, I always, I think I'm not sure how you are or everybody else, but you tend to always be your worst enemy. And I always felt horrible about my speech growing up, but then I met all these people who had, who had it like so much worse. I was like, you know, this is just not cool. They are young. They are doing awesome. So I need to do awesome too. And it was nice to walk into a room and have everyone completely understand what you've been through. Yeah, I can relate because I did not meet any other people that stutter myself until until six years ago in 2006, when I kind of had a rock bottom point in my life and, you know, reached out for some support and did some internet research and learned about the NSA and found out that they had a local chapter right in my area. And I didn't know that. And, you know, I went to a meeting and was just totally blown away by the fact that there were other people like me. And yeah, that in and of itself changed me. It took me a while though, honestly, Landon, because like when I first went and saw other people stuttering freely, I was really overwhelmed and got really emotional. And like at first didn't want to like, like admit that I was like part of them because I had been covert for a long time. But then after, you know, I gave myself permission to begin to work on accepting, just like you, it just like totally changed my whole attitude and allowed me to be much more free with how I feel about stuttering. So yeah, just meeting other people was just like mind blowing. It's do you find you said that you were. Covert and we have one guy and two girls who are all covert in my group. And I find that they need so much love because, you know, they've been going through that privately for so long. So I've watched all three of them change from, you know, from, you know, switching out words and not saying certain things, you know, being completely open and I think that just shows the strength of these groups. Yeah, that was me. That was me. Sweat, switching words, avoiding words and more importantly, I was I was avoiding situations, avoiding life because I was afraid of, you know, being found, found, found, found out number one and number two, being afraid of being judged. Yeah, that's so yeah. So I like the way that you say that, you know, people people that are covert need so much love, you know, because struggling to hide something that is so, so, so much apart, part of you is really hard work. So to witness their transformation and becoming open with themselves for you, that must be a really empowering thing to see and be part of. It's awesome. It's, you know, it's it just you can't help but make that feel to make you feel good at that. Because that's why the groups are there for everyone to grow. And, you know, it everyone's road is not the same left. We have a girl in there. I'm not going to say her name because she she's still she's still in the process of telling everyone she went to Fort Worth and had no idea that there was even a New Orleans chapter. And she ran into a she ran into a Stephen Kaufman. And then he found me and then she and I met and she's been at the group since then and to see her change has been, you know, she used to come to the group and not say a word. Now she actually like talk to she's like an actual part of the group. Oh, that's great. It's awesome. Yeah. What kind what kind what kinds of things do you talk talk talk talk about at the group? Like what type what what type of topics will usually come up? Well, you know. At first, you know, was kind of just an open talk, but then I found that we would benefit more from like a structured group. So I kind of like changed it. We tend to talk about like a whole bunch of stuff. We talked about, you know, things we do to improve our confidence. And this past month, we made a list of a bad sit. Duations, you may get into into and how you could best, you know, how you could best turn that into a positive. So it's kind of all over the place. But you know, every I think every time we have a group, I'll sit down and I'll figure out some, you know, some like key things this past month. We had three new people who they had only been coming for like two months. And they had only been coming for like two months and they just wanted to talk about the conference. So we spent quite a lot of time on that because they're dying to go. So so I just had everyone who had been to go around and explain, you know, how it was for them their first time and what they learned and all that stuff. And that seemed to like make them want to go, you know, 10 times more, which is awesome. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Now you mentioned confidence and you talk about how people in your group can, you know, work up on build building confidence. You yourself sound like you're a very confident person. Has that always been the case? Yeah, that is I've always kind of been full of myself. So I just naturally think I'm awesome. But I went through some really dark times with my speech. I was yeah, you know, I was the guy who was always like desperate to have friends and I would, you know, change for, you know, friends. And I went through a really dark time. I couldn't say my name for about like three years. So I would have to like write my name down and say hi. I'm, you know, hand them a piece of paper. But then I got to a point where I was, you know, I didn't have, you know, friends. So I had to figure out how to be cool with with myself. And, you know, that was not easy, but it was definitely worth everything in the end because now, you know, I find that as long as you're comfortable with yourself, everybody else will fall in line. To be honest, yeah, you said that you sometimes found found found yourself changing just to like suit the needs of people that might become your friends. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, in high school, it was really, really awful, like really terrible. You just, you know, I think if you don't have a strong, you know, character and yourself, you'll just go along with whatever you. But yeah, I also want because you know, you don't want to be alone. So, you know, just that kind of thing. Mm hmm. So did you do things that you wouldn't ordinarily have done just to kind of like fit in? Oh, probably. Yeah, probably. I can't think of anything specific. But yeah, I'm I guess I'm 15 and 16 year old kid. You really don't have any idea who you actually are. I think. Yeah. So I probably definitely did some stuff that, you know, is not really me. All right. Stuck around in situations where I would I'm not I do now. But yeah, that was not, you know, that's not really a great thing. I would not have found that. Anyone. Yeah, the the teen, the teen, the teenage years are certainly tough, tough, tough, tough enough. And then if you add a stutter to to it, yeah, you're right. We don't want to encourage 15 and 16 year olds to act like somebody. They're not just to try to fit in. It's definitely better to, you know, you know, encourage people people to be themselves. But as we both know, that's easier said than done. No. Oh, yeah. You know, and the thing that I had as you with what we moved from from eighth grade to nine grade, we moved. So I moved to a whole different town. I had to like start over. And. That's not easy either. So I was thrust into this thing where I knew nobody. So I had to just, you know, try my best. Yeah. What what were what was it like with your your teachers? Were they supportive? Uh, I mean, most of them were. But there are a few who I've laughed at me. When I would try to speak. Like, I always think about this one day where someone I got caught really bad on the word and the whole class and the teacher of the class began to like laugh at me. And I like, you know, like stormed out the class. I was crying. I called my mom and, you know, she came and picked me up. And, you know, I didn't. I didn't go to school for like three months because I just couldn't. Couldn't even deal with it. Wow. And, you know, my mom completely understood and she was great. And she, you know, she I think she could just sense that I couldn't do it. I was just beaten and done. Did anybody give that teacher hell? No. So she kind of got away. She kind of got away with laughing at a kid who stutters. Pretty much, yeah, you know, the school I moved to was like a super small school in a rural town. I was, you know, the strange kid. So I was in no open field. So that's tough. You know, I love I look back. At all that. And I'm glad that that occurred because I don't I don't know, you know, where I would have been if I had to get cool with myself. And that was we parked a lot of kids in in our groups about, you know, like a potential cure. And we have some who say I would take the cure in a heartbeat and others who say I wouldn't take the cure. I would personally not take the cure, also, because I find the best cure that I have found is being cool with me. And that's that's like the best thing you can ever. Hope for. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Absolute. Lutely. And, you know, that's like the healthiest attitude to certainly have. But it also sounds like you, you know, you've really learned some lessons about life and yourself along the way. Definitely, definitely. Do you still have any hard times now, like as an adult? I mean, do you have any sit situations now where you have people say dumb things to you or, you know, react negatively? Well, I think that that's always going to be there. And I used to be the, I used to get like super angry of dumb stuff like that. But now I'm at the point where, you know, I tried to take that time and educate because they may not know how unhelpful they're being. So you just have to put yourself out there and realize, you know, that's not cool, man. You're not helping me. Please, Timmy, a second, I'm doing the best I can. And I think for the most part, it helps if I don't take it in a more like confrontational way. If I just like explain to them that it's not cool, you know, please stop. Almost everyone understands that. When you were younger, did you ever punch anybody because they made fun of you? Tons of fights. Tons of fights. I got in fights every single day. Like every, every single day. It was horrible. It was terrible. I used to get, yeah, it was, I was, yeah, I got in a lot of fights, a lot of fights. So did you, so were you the winner in those fights or were you the one that got your butt kicked? I was pretty much the one that was, you know, being like, you know, beat up. Yeah. Oh, no. Like I was not that big of a kid. I was, I was thin and frail and I got gained some weight now. But yeah, like you don't generally fare too well when it's like the football players and the jocks who are like the main guys going off. I didn't ever give up. But I wouldn't say that I like, that I like won those fights. Now, you mentioned that, that, that, that your fiance, you know, really wanted you to go to that first and NSA meeting a couple of years ago. Does she stutter too? No, she is completely fluent at that. Actually, she is completely fluent. So what was her interest in going to the NSA meeting? I think she was just trying to get me to come and she probably understood that if she didn't go, I would probably not go either. She was only there as support. She is, you know, she's awesome. She is, you know, my best friend. She's great. She's super cool. And she, she will support doing it. And anything that she, you know, she thinks it will help. She will, she will without it, that be there. She actually still comes to groups. How did you guys meet? We met at a mutual friend's party. But we actually, this past W very was actually our five year end of treasury. Wow. So we met there. And from then on, I called her for two weeks to try to get a date. And finally, I wore her down and that was basically it. Yeah. What was her initial reaction to stuttering? Well, the thing was, my best friend had asked me to go to the sting. I went in, I only knew her. So I ended up, you know, being alone for like two hours. So I was drinking quite fast. And by the time she came, I was really drunk. And she thought I was like, like, a special need. Because I was, you know, I was very drunk and I was slurring on every single word. And she pulled my friend as I was like, what's wrong with him? And she's like, oh, you know, he's just drunk. But he does have this speech thing. And she had never met anyone else who stuttered. So I think she just took that as a learning experience. So she's been great. She's awesome. It sounds it. When are you guys getting married? We set the date for October 5th of next year. So we still have some time. We're trying to pay for it ourselves. And I'm not out of school yet. I'll be done in the fall. And I'll hopefully find a job soon after that. So, you know, we're trying to give ourselves time to pay for all of this because it is not cheap. Oh, I've heard. Yeah, I've heard like almost as much as it costs for a car. Yeah, it's a bit. I mean, it's not cheap. But we're only doing this once. So I think it's worth it for what is probably going to end up being one of the best days of our lives. Yeah, yeah. And you said you're in school. And when you introduced yourself, you said you were majoring in process engineering? Yeah, yeah. What was that? Well, you know, basically, I'll be working at like a chemical plant overseeing, you know, things that are made there. Sounds exciting. It probably won't be that exciting. But it'll be a great chance to learn. And the pay is awesome. Oh, good. Yeah, the pay is great. Has your speech ever interfered with your progress and participation in college? It has not at all. This past in the fall, I actually had to take a public speaking class. And the first day I showed up, I explained to the teacher who I was. And I explained about my speech. And I let him know that dad was not going to end up being any way. I ended up making like I think I made like a 98 in that class. So it was awesome. And I did great. And I was, you know, those kinds of things don't, you know, if I have to do it, I'll just do it. And I've never been the quiet guy, I guess. So I think that helped, too. I definitely get that impression, Landon, that you're not one of the quiet guys. I had a girl who came to our group. She was in school to be an herself peer. She actually just moved. And she now will go to a group in Florida. And she explained where she was from and who I was. And the guy who was in charge of the group, she's like, oh, I know him. I've seen him around. That's the guy who goes up and talks to everyone. Everyone knows this dude's name because he talks to everyone for four days. And she told me all that. And I was like, yeah, I guess I am that guy. I didn't completely, I didn't even know I was, but it seemed like I am. So that's fine, too. You know, you've already kind of talked about this, but I kind of want to just ask one final question as we begin to wind down. You mentioned that if there was ever a pill that could cure your stuttering at this point, you wouldn't take it. What's the most important thing you think that you've learned about yourself from the experience of being a person who stutters? I think that, like I said earlier, we all have really bad times. And it's not up to everyone else to help the situation. That falls on you. And I have to say, I think I'm going to stick with the fact that I worked super hard to get to a point where I was comfortable with myself. And after you become comfortable with you, there is nothing you can't do as long as you are focused and determined. So I think that those two things play a big part. I agree. And I love the way you just kind of summarize that. There's nothing we can't do. And I think that's the really pitamy of self-acceptance that no matter what we have, no matter what our situation is, if we believe in ourselves, which you definitely sound like you do, there's nothing we can't do. And that's an important message to get out there. So thank you so much for sharing your story with us. I really appreciate how honest you were in just going with a flow here with this conversation. Thank you for having me. This was awesome. Yeah, it was. And I wish I could give you a high five over the phone, because you really rock. And I'm looking forward to. We'll have to save that for Tampa. Absolutely. That is a definite. We're going to have to give each other a high five and a hug. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, thanks again, Landon. And this has been He Stutters. She asks him."
